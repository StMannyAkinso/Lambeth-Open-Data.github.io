1,Adaptation,"As well as reducing emissions across the borough, we 
must also prepare for the impacts of climate change. 
We know that weather patterns are changing, and our 
infrastructure, habitats, and communities are at risk 
from higher temperatures, increased rainfall and more 
unpredictable weather. These impacts typically affect 
poorer and more vulnerable groups in Lambeth who 
have fewer resources to adapt. ",#e40857
2,Buildings and Energy,"Our greatest use of energy is in heating and powering 
our buildings, and best-practice climate action requires 
us to reduce energy demand by retrofitting buildings 
to be warmer, more efficient and comfortable. We also 
need to ensure that the borough maximises the use 
and generation of low carbon and renewable energy",#ef7d00
3,Transport,"Emissions from transport make up almost a quarter of 
the total emissions from the borough, primarily from 
motor vehicles on our roads. Shifting how we travel 
towards walking, cycling and public transport, means 
that we can reduce the number of cars on our roads, 
reduce congestion (making bus rides quicker and more 
reliable) and improve our air quality. For those vehicles 
that will be necessary in the future, a switch to electric 
or other zero-emissions fuels will help to eliminate 
greenhouse gas emissions within the borough, as will 
last mile deliveries via cargo bikes.",#0088c2
4,"Waste, consumption and food","When we create waste by disposing of unwanted 
materials, this has a climate impact not only in 
terms of how that waste is disposed of, but it is also 
wasting all of the energy and resulting emissions 
that were generated in the production of that item. 
This also links to consumption – every purchase 
we make – as individuals or organisations - drives 
demand for production, which increases emissions 
(often elsewhere – outside Lambeth or even the UK). 
By reducing our consumption and switching to lower 
carbon goods, we can have an even greater influence 
on the emissions within and beyond our borough. 
Through climate action in the borough, we hope to 
influence and enable more people and businesses to make 
better decisions about what they buy, use and waste.",#00a4a6
5,Biodiversity and environmental quality,"The climate crisis is closely intertwined with the 
ecological crisis, with biodiversity plummeting globally. 
Green space, and nature, is important to us all; it helps 
to lower temperature and provide clean air, supports 
local wildlife and absorbs rainfall to reduce flood 
risk. Spending time outdoors in nature has proven 
benefits on both our physical and mental health. We 
want to ensure that as we tackle climate change, 
we also improve environmental quality and increase 
biodiversity in Lambeth",#4ba12f
